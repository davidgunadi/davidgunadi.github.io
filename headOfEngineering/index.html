    <p>Hi there, thank you for taking the time to apply. You can find our application process below.</p>

<h2>STEP 1 - Initial Assessment (Day 1)</h2>

        <ul>- a quick 60 seconds self introduction video recording</ul>
        <ul>- followed by a series of 5 x 10 minutes assessments for various topics (technical and non-technical)</ul></p>
    
<h2>STEP 2 - Interview with our VP of Engineering (Day 2-3)</h2>
    <p>Once you completed the assessment, you will be invited to a one hour interview (including a 15 minutes live coding interview using a language of your choice).</p>

<h2>STEP 3 - Interview with our Founders (Day 4-5)</h2>
    <p>The last step would be a direct interview with our Founder, to ensure that McEasy is a good fit for you.</p>
