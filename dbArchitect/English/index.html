    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our Database Architect Job.<br>
    Below, we have provided some questions, so we can get to know you better.<br>
    Thank you for your time<br></p>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <p>1.	Name a time when you used database denormalization, and why.</p>
    <p>2.	Name a time when you used NoSQL, and why.?</p>

    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <p>You are required to build a database, using any technology you want.<br>
        This database will receive 100 million records from various different vendors per hour.</br>
        The info is sent from GPS device (attached to a vehicle), and is received by a Kernel.</br>
        The info contains the GPS IMEI Number, Longitude, Latitude, Speed, and numerous other additional fields.</p>
    
    <p>You would also need these raw data to provide "live view" for the end user from a website.<br>
        The live view would be shown over a map, showing all vehicle position, how fast it is currently going, and the last time the GPS information was received.</br>
        At any given time, 100 thousands end user will access your site, so performance is crucial.</br></p>

    <p>Given the freedom to do anything you want, how would you design the database structure / technologies to ensure these following three things:<br>
        a. Performance<br>
        b. Cost and Efficiency<br>
        c. Scalability<br><br>

        Some things that you might consider are:<br>
        a. Should you create one database for all, or separate them based on Vendor?<br>
        b. Cloud / Local Server?<br>
        c. Would you consider using other technologies such as REDIS, etc?<br><br></p>
